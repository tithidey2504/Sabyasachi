            <p>“The value of jewellery for today’s connoisseur goes far beyond the provenance of <br>gemstones. It’s about design, craft and wearability. As heritage crafts get rarer and as they <br>become more endangered, their legacy will become more valuable than the most precious <br>of gemstones. These are the heirlooms that will find their pride of place in museums tomorrow.”</p>
